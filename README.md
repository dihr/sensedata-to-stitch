# Sensedata-to-stitch

After spending a lot of time looking for a decent tutorial on "how to create taps for singer", I found that the easiest way was to create an integration from scratch.

# The problem

The problem consisted of: using the Sensedata api to get data about clients, tasks and other entities... importing this data into the Stitch system. 
Once Stitch has the data imported, it inserts the data into the database.

# Conclusion.

The amount of processes and steps that must be taken to build a tap is unrealistic, boring and unnecessary.

Instead of looking for tutorials and documentation that get us nowhere, the best way to solve any problem is "Do it by yourself" and "Make it as simple as possible".
